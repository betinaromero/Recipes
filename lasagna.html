    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. </p>
            <p>Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes.</p> 
            <p>Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.</li></p>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li></p>
        <p><li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles.</p>
            <p>Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese.</p>
            <p>Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is.</p>
            <p>Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it.</p> 
            <p>Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.</p></li>
    </ol>
