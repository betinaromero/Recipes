    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <p><li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li></p>
        <p><li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped garlic</li></p>
        <p><li>2 tablespoons ground pork</li></p>
        <p><li>4 cups cooked white rice</li></p>
        <p><li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic salt</li></p>
        <p><li>Ground black pepper to taste</li></p>
    </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <p><li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and ground pork.</p>
                 <p>Cook and stir until the garlic is golden brown. This is the color you want for maximum flavor, do not allow it to burn, or the flavor will be bitter.</p></li>

                <p>Cook and stir until heated through and well blended, about 3 minutes. Serve and enjoy.</p></li>
